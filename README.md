# Welcome to your Project Ncrypt      --- DEMO WEBSITE

## Project Ncrypt is a futuristic offline identity verification system that uses NFC smart cards to simplify and secure citizen interactions — from casting votes to accessing government services like ration distribution, healthcare, and pensions.

# 🚀 Features
✅ Tap-to-Verify Voting – Eliminates manual ID checks at polling booths.

🔒 Fingerprint Authentication – Verifies the real cardholder without storing sensitive data.

🚫 Anti-Cloning Protection – Detects and blocks fake or cloned cards using digital signature verification.

🌐 Offline-First – Works securely without any internet connection.

🏛️ Government Services Hub – One card to access all services like:

   > Ration Centers 🍚

   > Government Hospitals 🏥

   > Pension Schemes 👴

# 🧠 Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React (for smooth UX)

Backend Logic: Simulated NFC + Fingerprint validation

Security: Simulated RSA-4096 digital signature validation

Demo: Fully interactive website-based simulation (desktop/mobile)

# 🎯 Use Case
Designed for developing nations and global democracies facing:

Long queues and manual processes in voting

Identity fraud in government schemes

Lack of seamless integration across services

# 💡 Inspired By
Real-world issues in digital governance, especially during elections and public welfare distribution.
